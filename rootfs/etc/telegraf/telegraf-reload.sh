# A script to help with telegraf reloads. Needs sudo for :80.
#
# Receives the reload strategy as the first parameter:
#  native <.cfg>
#    Uses native HAProxy soft restart. Running it for the first time starts
#    HAProxy, each subsequent invocation will perform a soft-reload.
#  multibinder <.cfg.erb>
#    Used on multibinder deployment. Send USR2 to the
#    multibinder-telegraf-wrapper process.
#
# HAProxy options:
#  -f config file
#  -p pid file
#  -D run as daemon
#  -sf soft reload, wait for pids to finish handling requests
#      send pids a resume signal if reload of new config fails
